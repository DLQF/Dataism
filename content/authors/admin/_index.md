I am an Assistant Professor in the Department of Economics and the Computational Modeling and Data Analytics, College of Science, Virginia Tech.  

My research focuses on the intersection of statistical machine learning and big data econometrics, with a particular interest in high-dimensional nonlinear time-series analysis and their applications in macroeconomic/financial forecasting and estimation of big financial networks.  I received my Ph.D. (2017) from the London School of Economics and Political Science, Department of Statistics.

I also work occasionally as a consultant for financial firms and governmental organizations for all businesses related to pattern recognition and knowledge discovery, especially computer modeling and forecasting. I have been in the industry for a few years, working as a trader and portfolio strategist and developing different algorithmic trading strategies.
